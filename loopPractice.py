# Write a function called doubles() that takes one number as its input
# and doubles that number. Then use the doubles() function in a
# loop to double the number 2 three times, displaying each result on
# a separate line. Here is some sample output:

def doubles(num):

# An initial deposit, called the principal amount, is made. Each year,
# the amount increases by a fixed percentage, called the annual rate of
# return.
# For example, a principal amount of $100 with an annual rate of return
# of 5% increases the first year by $5. The second year, the increase is
# 5% of the new amount $105, which is $5.25.
# Write a function called invest with three parameters: the principal
# amount, the annual rate of return, and the number of years to calculate. 
# The function signature might look something like this:
principal=float(input("Enter a principal amount :"))
annualrate=float(input("Enter a annual rate :"))
years=int(input("Enter a number of years :"))
